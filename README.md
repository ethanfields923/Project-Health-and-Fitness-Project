Directions for running and testing:
1. Before Running:
   . First make sure that node.js is installed on your PC. If not, download the current node.js version(v21.7.1) running x64 from this link, https://nodejs.org/en/download/current, for the appropriate system of course(Windows, Mac, Linux). Once the wizard opens up, just download the default version and do NOT download the additional Chocolatey software. 
   . Then, download the project zip folder and extract it.
   . Once that is completed, open up a terminal in the location of the fitness project folder and run the command "npm init". You can just keep pressing enter until you get to the prompt where it asks if these parameters are acceptable and enter "Y" for yes. After this step is completed, a 'package.json' file should be added to the project folder. Additionally, the server.js can now be ran using the command 'node server.js' in the terminal.
   . Use the command "npm install" and "npm install pg" to install the appropriate modules required for this project. This will include a 'package-lock.json file' and 'node_modules' folder/directory in your project folder/directory.
